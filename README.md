# Flag Corps 1.0.1
better unit flags

## improves unit flag layout and design
- horizontal “parade” of unit flags for easier selection
- red borders for enemy civilizations and their city-state allies

## fixes and customizes game features

- optionally remove the black “shadow” from unit flags

## compatibility with other mods
known interactions:

  installed, Flag Corps manages unit flags.

## localization
the mod is language-independent during play.
only the menu screens (Mods and Options) contain localized text.

supported languages:
