# Flag Corps 3.0.1
better banners and flags

## improves city banner design
- tooltips with connection, growth, and production info
- town focus and civilization icons
- more readable lighting effects for text and icons
- better integration of health bars and timers
- more consistent layout from one settlement to another

## improves unit flag layout and design
- horizontal “parade” of unit flags for easier selection
- red borders for enemy civilizations and their city-state allies

## fixes and customizes game features
- city banners show changes from resource reallocation (like happiness)
- unit & district health bars adjusted to show damage more accurately
- city leader portraits react to alliances, war, and unhappiness
- neutral city-states have a neutral allegiance ring (not red)
- religion icons merged unless urban and rural religion differ
- unrest countdown hidden when razing a settlement
- (optionally) remove leader portraits from city banners
- (optionally) remove the black outline from unit flags

## compatibility with other mods
known interactions:

- **F1rstDan's Cool UI: compatible.**  the new Flag Corps banner design
  smoothly integrates with the Cool UI connections icon.
- **Sukritact's Simple UI Adjustments: compatible.**  when both mods are
  installed, Flag Corps manages unit flags.
